          What is your website about?
          <p>
            My project will be about Algo Filipino's U.S.A. Chapter.
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/algofilipino/" target="_blank">
              Algo Filipino
            </a>
            is a non-profit organization that I'm currently involved in. Its main mission is to
            increase the accessibility of technology education among the Filipino
            youth by promoting the native language as the primary mode of learning. 
            The main chapter is based in the Philippines, but we are
            looking to expand to the U.S.A.

          What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this
          site be important?)
          <p>
            The objective of my website is to inform people about Algo
            Filipino's mission and vision, current projects and programs, and
            how they can become involved in the organization. Currently, Algo
            Filipino only has Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin pages as a way
            to promote the organization. Developing a website for the chapter
            will therefore be important in establishing our credibility and
            furthering our online presence.

          Who is your target audience set?
          <p>
            The target audience for this website will be Filipino and
            Filipino-American High School and College students in the United
            States who are interested in entering the field of technology,
            learning about the native language, or becoming involved in a
             youth organization operating in the Philippines.
